// This project sets up two scripts that can be run using npm to publish and consume events
// to and from the nats streaming server running in the kubernetes cluster.

// Generate a package.json file with
npm init -y

// Install dependencies
npm install node-nats-streaming ts-node-dev typescript @types/node

// Create the publish and listen node source files

// Add the publish and listen scripts to package.json to run these source files.

// Create a tsconfig.json file in the project by running
tsc --init

npm install -g typescript

// To setup kubernetes to forward outside ports straight to the nats pod do the following.
// This is a quick and easy way to let these scripts publish and consume to the nats pod
// in a dev environment without setting up complicated infrastructure.
// Get the nats pod name without
kubectl get pods
Then forward ports to it
kubectl port-forward nats-depl-XXXXXX 4222:4222
// Then from another terminal run
npm run publish
// To break this port forwarding, just stop the process that is running it.

// To see the monitoring app in NATS, first forward the ports that the monitoring is set up on in the deployment yaml file
kubectl port-forward nats-depl-XXXXXX 8222:8222
// Open web browser and go to http://localhost:8222/streaming
